I created a website for the company Filip Foto Film, a one man video producer company.

Since I knew sÂ´this was going to be a large project I knew I wanted to make as much as possible fit into reusable, styled components. 
I also wanted me (and client) to be able to change content, such as images, video and text, in an easy way. That's why everything is in a database and fetched to components using tags to place it in the right position.


I used: 
* React
* React Router
* React Responsive
* Styled components
* Node
* MongoDB - database for all content
* one.com - Storage of content
* one.com - domain, webhosting (soon)
* Google cloud - Backend
* jamboard - for task management

I knew from the start that this project would span for a longer period of time than the 3 weeks of final project at Technigo and that's why there are a lot of more things I will do. At the moment all pages does not have the right content, but there is a prepared place for it so there is minimal work left when I get it. That, a nicer looking navbar, links to social media, a footer, deploying on one.com and more, would definitely fit under the headline "when I have more time".
